# Adaptive Claims Protocol
Smart contract protocol to support sustainable mining initiatives around the world. 

The Adaptive Claim System enables producers, responsible trade actors, and civil society organizations to connect and to share the responsibility and costs of supply chain due diligence. The application provides financial incentives and targeted resources across the value chain. The Adaptive protocol is a framework of blockchain smart contracts that generate non-fungible ‘claim tokens’ representing an underlying physical asset. Tokens can be purchased and traded by downstream supply chain actors.
